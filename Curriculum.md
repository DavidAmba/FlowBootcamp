    - Commit 7: Define and deploy your own contract that stores a dictionary of resources. Add a function to get a reference to one of those resources in the dictionary.
    - Commit 8: Tag areas where certain variables can be read. Upload the commit of your answers with this picture.


# Advanced: FEB 2ND
## Chapter 4: Variables and Types in Cadence

Lesson 1: Variables and Constants in Cadence
- Lesson 2: Type System in Cadence
- Lesson 3: Cadence Functions and Control Flow

    - Commit 9: Define a contract that returns a resource that has at least 1 field in it. Then, write 2 transactions:
      - A transaction that first saves the resource to account storage, then loads it out of account storage, logs a field inside the resource, and destroys it.
      - A transaction that first saves the resource to account storage, then borrows a reference to it, and logs a field inside the resource.

## Chapter 5: Writing Your First Cadence Script

- Lesson 1: Functions and Procedures in Cadence
- Lesson 2: Control Flow Statements in Cadence
- Lesson 3: Writing Your First Cadence Script

- Commit 10: Deploy a contract that contains a resource that implements a resource interface. Then, do the following:
      - In a transaction, save the resource to storage and link it to the public with the restrictive interface.
      - Run a script that tries to access a non-exposed field in the resource interface, and see the error pop up.
      - Run the script and access something you CAN read from. Return it from the script.
